# Machine Learning / NLP Utility Functions
The notebook in this repository contains utility functions which I found useful for my research. At the moment, it contains:

### ML
1. Accuracy in Pytorch
2. Precision, Recall, F1 in Pytorch
3. Setting seeds

### NLP
1. Gradient Clipping
2. BERT Word Embeddings

I've added the `environment.yml` for reproducibility of the notebook. However, I've tried to keep each cell self-contained such that users only need to install the dependencies in the cell.

Feel free to use them for your own research (ง︡'-'︠)ง.
